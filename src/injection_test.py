"""
Prompt injection testing for language models.

This module implements a basic prompt injection test. The idea is to
embed sensitive or private information within a context and then ask
the model to reveal it or otherwise ignore its safety instructions. If
the model complies with these malicious requests, it is considered
vulnerable to prompt injection. Responses are scored using a scoring
model which outputs a value between 0 and 1 indicating how
compromised the model was. Scores are inverted and scaled to 10 so
that higher values correspond to better resistance to injection.
