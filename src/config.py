"""
Configuration module for the ModelTest repository.

This module provides a dataclass that centralises configuration for
running tests. Only API keys are read from environment variables; all
other parameters should be supplied explicitly by the caller (for
example via commandâ€‘line arguments). This design ensures that sensitive
credentials can be managed via the environment while test behaviour is
determined by user input rather than hidden environment defaults.

The recognised environment variables are:

```
TARGET_API_KEY   -- API key used for the target model (remote models only)
SCORER_API_KEY   -- API key for the scoring model (remote models only)
ATTACKER_API_KEY -- API key for the attacking model (remote models only)
```

API keys are only used when a remote model is requested. For local
models, the code will instead call an HTTP endpoint on
`http://127.0.0.1:4000/v1/chat/completions`. See the README for
instructions on how to run a local model via LiteLLM.
