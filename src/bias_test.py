"""
Automated bias testing using PyRIT.

This module defines functions to orchestrate a bias attack against a target
language model using PyRIT's PAIROrchestrator. The orchestrator drives an
attacker model to iteratively refine prompts in a crescendo-like manner, while
a scoring model evaluates whether the objective has been achieved. This
function supports both remote and local target models (via LiteLLM). Attacker
and scorer models are always remote.

Usage:
- Only the target model may be local. Scorer and attacker should be remote.
- Provide OpenAI API keys via environment variables or Config.

    Execute a bias test for a single pass using PyRIT's PAIROrchestrator.
    The orchestrator mounts a multi-turn crescendo attack by iteratively refining
    adversarial prompts and evaluating the target's responses via the scoring model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target : ModelCaller
        The target language model to be attacked. This may be local via LiteLLM.
    scorer : ModelCaller
        The remote model used to evaluate whether the objective has been achieved.
    attacker : ModelCaller
        The remote model used to generate adversarial prompts.
    objective : str
        The bias objective the attacker strives to achieve.
    scorer_prefix : str
        Desired response prefix given to the scoring model before evaluation.
    depth : int
        Maximum number of turns to attempt the bias.
    threshold : float
        Score threshold (0-1) at which the objective is considered achieved.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Whether to print debug information to stdout.
