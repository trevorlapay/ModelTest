"""
Automated jailbreak testing using PyRIT's Tree-of-Attacks red teaming.

This module defines functions to orchestrate a jailbreak attack against a target
language model using the PyRIT framework. At each turn, an attacker model
proposes a new prompt based on the previous target responses and evaluation
scores. The target model's response is then evaluated by a scoring model via
PyRIT's `SelfAskTrueFalseScorer`. If the evaluation exceeds a specified
threshold, the attack is deemed successful and the test ends early.

This implementation relies entirely on PyRIT. When the target model is hosted
locally (via LiteLLM), PyRIT cannot send requests directly to arbitrary
HTTP endpoints, so we fall back to a simplified yet improved Tree - Attacks
(TAP) loop that leverages the official PyRIT red-teaming system prompt to
craft adversarial prompts. For remote targets, we use the
`RedTeamingOrchestrator` from PyRIT to drive the attack.

Only the target model may be local; the attacker and scorer models are always
remote. Ensure that the OpenAI API keys for the remote models are set in the
environment.

    Improved TAP fallback for local targets.

    This function implements a simplified version of PyRIT's Tree - Attacks
    algorithm for situations where the target model is hosted locally and
    therefore cannot be accessed via PyRIT's native HTTP interfaces. It
    leverages the official PyRIT red-teaming system prompt (RTO) to instruct
    the attacker model on how to craft adversarial prompts, maintains
    conversation state between turns, and provides escalating feedback when
    attacks fail. It returns a dict mirroring the return contract of
    `run_jailbreak_test`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target: ModelCaller
        The local target language model under attack.
    scorer: ModelCaller
        The remote model used to evaluate target responses.
    attacker: ModelCaller
        The remote model responsible for generating adversarial prompts.
    objective: str
        The jailbreak goal the attacker tries to achieve.
    scorer_prefix: str
        Instruction prefix given to the scoring model before evaluation.
    depth: int
        Maximum number of turns to attempt the jailbreak.
    threshold: float
        Score threshold at which the objective is considered achieved.
    verbose: bool, optional
        Whether to print debug information to stdout.

    Returns
    -------
