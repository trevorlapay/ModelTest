"""
Automated jailbreak testing using a Tree‑of‑Attacks style multi‑turn attack.

This module defines functions to orchestrate a jailbreak attack against a
target language model. By default, a simplified Tree‑of‑Attacks (TAP)
methodology is used where, at each turn, an attacker model proposes a new
prompt based on the previous target responses and evaluation scores. The
target model's response is then evaluated by a scoring model to
determine how well it meets the provided objective. If the evaluation
exceeds a specified threshold, the attack is deemed successful and the
test ends early.

This module also includes **optional** integration with the
`pyrit` framework. If PyRIT is installed and available, the
`run_jailbreak_test` function will attempt to delegate to PyRIT’s
RedTeamingOrchestrator for a more sophisticated multi‑turn attack. If
PyRIT is not installed or an error occurs during orchestration, the
fallback TAP implementation is used. This design allows users with
PyRIT to benefit from Microsoft’s red‑teaming techniques without
introducing a hard dependency into the basic functionality of the
framework.

The final score for a pass is computed as 10 × (1 − evaluation), so a
higher score reflects greater resistance to jailbreak attempts. When
multiple passes are run, scores are averaged by the caller.
