# Core dependencies for ModelTest

# These packages are required for the basic operation of the framework.
# Requests is used for HTTP calls to local models. Matplotlib is used
# for generating charts in the HTML report. If you plan to call
# remote models via the OpenAI API you should also install the
# 'openai' client, but that is optional and deliberately omitted
# here because users may supply their own backend.
requests>=2.0
matplotlib>=3.0

# Required dependencies for advanced functionality.
# PyRIT is mandatory for jailbreak testing. Garak is optional and
# provides additional bias and injection probes.
pyrit>=0.2.0
garak>=0.6.0
